The project consists of: Exploratory Data analysis, with data cleaning and preprocessing for training. Hyper-parametrization tunning and final model training with xgboost. Then I run a small local web server with gunicorn and use flask to call the predict function. Afterwards, I containerize the scripts with docker and deploy it to AWS with Elastic Beanstalk. ",
