                    <p class="subtitle">Data Science, Engineering, Visualization and ML.</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Ph.D. in Bioinformatics with Computer Engineering
                        background. 13+ years of experience in research, data
                        science, and software engineering.

                        As an experienced recruiter focused on hiring top data science, AI/ML, and data engineering talent, I would love to see a well-designed portfolio that clearly showcases a candidate's skills, experience, and passion for their craft. Here's what I would consider an ideal portfolio:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Design:
                        <br>
                        Clean, modern, and visually appealing layout
                        <br>
                        Consistent branding and use of typography, colors, and imagery
                        <br>
                        Responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile
                        <br>
                        Intuitive navigation to quickly access key information
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Content:
                        <br>
                        Essential:
                        <br>
                        An engaging introduction that highlights the candidate's background, expertise, and career goals
                        <br>
                        A summary of technical skills, including programming languages, tools, frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge
                        <br>
                        A curated selection of 3-5 featured projects that demonstrate the candidate's problem-solving abilities and depth of knowledge
                        <br>
                        For each project, include a brief description, the tech stack used, and the candidate's role/contributions
                        <br>
                        Showcase a diverse range of projects, from proof-of-concepts to end-to-end solutions
                        <br>
                        Links to the candidate's GitHub profile, LinkedIn, and any other relevant online presence
                        <br>
                        Contact information and a clear call-to-action for the recruiter to reach out
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Nice-to-have:
                        <br>
                        Detailed case studies for the featured projects, covering the problem statement, approach, challenges, and outcomes
                        <br>
                        Relevant certifications, awards, or recognition the candidate has received
                        <br>
                        Links to any published articles, conference talks, or open-source contributions
                        <br>
                        Testimonials or recommendations from previous managers, colleagues, or clients
                        <br>
                        A section highlighting the candidate's hobbies, interests, and extracurricular activities (to get a sense of their well-roundedness)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The portfolio should strike a balance between showcasing technical expertise and demonstrating the candidate's broader capabilities, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. It's also important that the portfolio is kept up-to-date and reflects the candidate's most recent and impactful work.
                        <br>
                        As a recruiter, I would be particularly impressed by a portfolio that not only highlights the candidate's technical prowess but also their ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges and deliver meaningful business impact. By carefully curating the content and presenting it in a visually compelling manner, the candidate can effectively differentiate themselves and increase their chances of standing out in a competitive job market.
